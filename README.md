# VulkanDemoProjects
Demo Projects for Vulkan 

## Demos:

* Texture Arrays: demonstrates using an array of textures (not an array texture!), and selecting images from that array using a push constant

* Uniform Buffer Arrays: demonstrates using a single vkbuffer to store data for different shaders' uniforms (all the same size, with different contents), and indexing into that vkBuffer using a push constant in the shaders
